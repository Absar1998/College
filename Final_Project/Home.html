        <h3>Ryan Storme</h3>
        <p>One of the biggest decisions you will make financially is what home to
          purchase. To find that perfect house, every homeowner needs a real estate
          agent that will take the time to understand their big picture goals and to
          educate them on the home buying or selling process. Explaining each step
          along the way and what to anticipate next keeps expectations realistic and
          lessen the unknowns. </p>

          is what sets your home from the rest of the inventory and a savvy agent
          knows where to find the buyer and bring them to your door.</p>

          time with a real estate agent. It's important to start working with the
          right agent who has the knowledge, experience, and patience to help you move
          on into your new home.</p>
